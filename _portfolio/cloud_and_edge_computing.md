## Context

Among the first courses I encountered during my final year at 5ISS was **Cloud and Edge Computing**. This course introduced me to core concepts of both distributed and pervasive computing, along with a basic architecture that incorporated techniques such as Service Oriented Computing (SOC), virtualization, and cloud technologies. Combining theoretical foundations with hands-on practice, the course provided insight into how these paradigms shape modern IT systems and their applications.

## Technical Summary

The course covered a variety of virtualization techniques, including:

- **Hypervisors:** Both Type 1 and Type 2.
- **Paravirtualization** and **Containerization**.
- **Virtual Machine Templates,** which simplify the management and deployment of virtual environments.

A key highlight was the comparison between **service orchestration** and **service choreography**:

- **Orchestration:** Uses a centralized approach that eases updates but can slow down the system.
- **Choreography:** Is decentralized, enhancing autonomy, though it requires a more complex design process.

Additionally, the course emphasized cloud computing by exploring:

- Definitions based on the widely recognized **NIST framework**.
- Core characteristics such as on-demand services, scalability, and pay-per-use models.
- Service delivery models like **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**, **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**, and **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**.

We also examined **edge computing** and its crucial role in IoT ecosystems, particularly its ability to reduce latency and uphold data sovereignty. However, edge computing also poses challenges, such as connectivity limitations and constrained processing power. Finally, the course introduced **fog computing** as an intermediary layer that bridges cloud services with data sources, reducing the distance data must travel and enabling real-time interaction—a process the professor described as the “cloudification of the IoT world.”

## Practical Work

The practical component was divided into two major sessions:

1. **Cloud Hypervisors Exploration:**  
   We engaged with tools like VirtualBox and the OpenStack API to experiment with various virtualization techniques in controlled environments.

2. **Service Orchestration in Hybrid Cloud and Edge Environments:**  
   This session focused on deploying and managing a distributed system across both cloud and edge architectures, providing practical insights into their complexities and potential.

These sessions were essential in bridging theory with real-world applications, solidifying my comprehension and boosting my confidence in managing hybrid architectures.

## Analysis and Remarks

I appreciated the well-structured practical sessions that effectively combined theory and practice. Each session began with a theoretical introduction to reinforce central concepts, followed by an implementation phase using tools like VirtualBox and OpenStack APIs. This approach not only deepened my understanding of virtualization and orchestration but also equipped me with concrete skills that mirror real-world workflows.

## Reflections

This course significantly enhanced my understanding of how cloud and edge computing systems interact to create innovative, scalable, and efficient solutions. The seamless integration of theoretical and practical aspects has prepared me to tackle the challenges of analyzing and managing distributed systems. As I plan to pursue a specialized master’s degree in cybersecurity, I recognize the importance of mastering virtualization, container orchestration, and hybrid architectures in designing robust defenses against emerging threats.

Through the labs, I developed not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential qualities for my future career in cybersecurity.
