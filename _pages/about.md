Hi everyone! I'm ClÃ©ment GauchÃ© (#Raspeur) ðŸ––

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m an Engineering student currently studying Innovative Smart Systems at INSA Toulouse. My goal is to specialize in cybersecurity. Alongside my studies, I work as an embedded systems engineer at Schaeffler (formerly Vitesco Technologies).

On this website, I want to share my professional, academic, and personal projects, as well as summaries of the courses I have taken.

Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback on the website format or if you have ideas for improvements. I would be very grateful.

This website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator coded in Ruby. I use a fork of the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template.
